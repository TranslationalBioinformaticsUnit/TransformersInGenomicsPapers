| [Evaluating the Utilities of Foundation Models in Single-cell Data Analysis](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.09.08.555192v5). Tianyu Liu et al. _bioRxiv_ (2024)   |  [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/HelloWorldLTY/scEval)   |  scGPT, scFoundation, tGPT, GeneCompass, SCimilarity, UCE, and CellPLM | This paper evaluates the performance of foundation models (FMs) in single-cell sequencing data analysis, comparing them to task-specific methods across eight downstream tasks and proposing a systematic evaluation framework (scEval) for training and fine-tuning single-cell FMs. The study highlights that while single-cell FMs may not always outperform task-specific methods, they show promise in cross-species/cross-modality transfer learning and possess unique emergent abilities.    | Open-source single-cell FMs generally outperform closed-source ones due to their accessibility and the community feedback they receive; pre-training significantly enhances model performance in tasks like Cell-type Annotation and Gene Function Prediction. However, the study also found limitations in the stability and performance of single-cell FMs across certain tasks, suggesting the need for more nuanced training and fine-tuning processes, and indicating substantial room for improvement in their development. |
| [Foundation Models Meet Imbalanced Single-Cell Data When Learning Cell Type Annotations](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.24.563625v1). Abdel Rahman Alsabbagh et al. _bioRxiv_ (2023)  | [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/SabbaghCodes/ImbalancedLearningForSingleCellFoundationModels)   | scGPT, scBERT, and Geneformer |  The paper focuses on evaluating the performance of three single-cell foundation models‚ÄîscGPT, scBERT, and Geneformer‚Äîwhen trained on datasets with imbalanced cell-type distributions. It explores how these models handle skewed data distributions, particularly in the context of cell-type annotation.  | scGPT and scBERT perform comparably well in cell-type annotation tasks, while Geneformer lags presumably due to its unique gene tokenization method, with all models benefiting from random oversampling to address data imbalances. Additionally, scGPT offers the fastest computational speed using FlashAttention, whereas scBERT is the most memory-efficient, highlighting trade-offs between speed and memory usage in these foundation models. The paper suggests that future directions should explore enhanced data representation strategies and algorithmic innovations, including tokenization and sampling techniques, to further mitigate imbalanced learning challenges in single-cell foundation models, aiming to improve their robustness across diverse biological datasets.  |
| [Reusability report: Learning the transcriptional grammar in single-cell RNA-sequencing data using transformers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-023-00757-8). Sumeer Ahmad Khan et al. _Nature Machine Intelligence_ (2023)      | [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TranslationalBioinformaticsUnit/scbert-reusability)     | scBERT | This paper focuses on evaluating the reusability and generalizability of the scBERT method, originally designed for cell-type annotation in single-cell RNA-sequencing data, beyond its initial datasets. It highlights the significant impact of cell-type distribution on scBERT's performance and introduces a subsampling technique to mitigate imbalanced data distribution, offering insights for optimizing transformer models in single-cell genomics.    | While scBERT can reproduce the main results in cell-type annotation, its performance is significantly affected by the distribution of cells per cell type, particularly struggling with novel cell types in imbalanced datasets. Addressing this distributional sensitivity is crucial, suggesting future work should focus on developing methods to handle class imbalance and leveraging domain knowledge to enhance transformer models in single-cell genomics. |
| [Assessing the limits of zero-shot foundation models in single-cell biology](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.16.561085v2). Kasia Z. Kedzierska et al. _bioRxiv_ (2023) | [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/zero-shot-scfoundation)    | Geneformer and scGPT  | The main focus of this paper is to rigorously evaluate the zero-shot performance of foundation models, specifically Geneformer and scGPT, in single-cell biology to determine their efficacy in tasks like cell type clustering and batch effect correction.   | Geneformer and scGPT exhibit inconsistent and often underwhelming performance in zero-shot settings for single-cell biology tasks like cell type clustering and batch effect correction, often falling behind simpler methods like scVI and highly variable gene selection. Pretraining these models on larger and more diverse datasets offers limited benefits, underscoring the need for more focused research to improve the robustness and utility of foundation models in single-cell biology.   |

Tegner. _Nature Machine Intelligence_ (2023)      | This paper emphasizes the successful adaptation of machine translation models, particularly transformers like BERT, for the task of cell type annotation in single-cell genomics. It highlights the development of scBERT, which leverages pretraining and self-supervised learning to create robust cell embeddings that are less sensitive to batch effects and capable of detecting subtle dependencies such as rare cell types.              | Despite demonstrating strong performance across diverse datasets and tasks, the paper acknowledges limitations, such as the need for embedding binning and the lack of integration with underlying biological processes like gene-regulatory networks. The authors suggest future research directions, including improving the generalization of embeddings to continuous values and developing more nuanced masking strategies. The paper concludes by noting the potential for transformers to be applied to other tasks in single-cell biology and anticipates growing interest in integrating AI methods beyond computer vision into bioinformatics and single-cell genomics. |

BEND includes seven tasks that assess the models' ability to capture functional elements across various length scales. |The main results of the BEND benchmark reveal that DNA language models (LMs) show promising but mixed performance across different tasks. Nucleotide Transformer (NT-MS) performed best overall, particularly in gene finding, histone modification, and CpG methylation tasks. DNABERT excelled in chromatin accessibility prediction, matching the performance of the Basset model. However, no model consistently outperformed all others, and long-range tasks like enhancer annotation remained challenging for all models.

By adapting the transformer architecture, traditionally used in natural language processing, LLMs offer a novel approach to uncover genomic patterns, predict functional elements, and enhance genomic data interpretation. The review delves into transformer-hybrid models and emerging architectures beyond transformers, outlining their applications, benefits, and limitations in genomic data analysis. The goal is to bridge gaps between computational biology and machine learning in the evolving field of genomics. | The paper emphasizes that while transformer-based LLMs have significantly advanced genomic modeling, challenges like scaling to larger contexts and maintaining interpretability remain. Innovations such as the Hyena layer promise to address computational inefficiencies, further pushing the boundaries of genomic data analysis. Future research should focus on improving context length, integrating multi-omic data, and refining interpretability to fully realize the potential of LLMs. Overall, the review highlights the transformative potential of these models in genomics, pointing toward an exciting future for computational biology. |
